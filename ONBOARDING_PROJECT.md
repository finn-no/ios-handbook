Welcome to the FINN iOS team. We have a project prepared for you to get used to some of the decisions we've taken as well to get feedback on them.

Some of the topics that you'll cover here are:
- Code style
- Architecture
- Folder naming and structure
- Networking
- Persistency
- Animations and transitions

The project consists of making a simple app to search for recipes. You should be able to favorite some of the recipes and see them offline.

_**Welcome to FINN!**_ We are happy of having you with us, we have written this guide to get you started in your journey of _making the FINN app great again_! If any of the steps are outdated or any information is missing please send a pull request.

First of all, [Okta](https://schibsted.okta.com) is your main gateway for all the things Schibsted (FINN), here you'll find direct links to all the apps you've access to.

- [ ] Request access your manager to get access to the FINN organization in GitHub Enterprise (https://github.schibsted.io)

- [ ] Download Slack app (https://slack.com/downloads/osx)
- [ ] Feel free to use your personal Apple account for downloading apps
- [ ] https://sch-chat.slack.com
- [ ] Press the "Sign with Okta" button

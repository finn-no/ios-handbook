## Firebase
Firebase crash reporting seem to be working. Crashes are coming in as expected. We can remove some more usage of AppCenter so we only keep distribution part since that is all we are using.

Adding Firebase Performance could be useful to see if it gives some good insight.

## Catalina
Half of us are not yet on Catalina and unable to upgrade to latest Xcode. Try to get some more info from support how we should solve this. It should work fine for now to have a mix of Xcode 11.3 and 11.4, but unsure how long it will work.

## Tip
Use the Pulse Secure app on iPhone if you want to connect to DEV from actual device.

### Long Term goal:
- Manually test new features on simulator/device, especially iPad. This is meant as a friendly reminder ðŸ˜‡

### Short Term goal: (After Christmas release)
- Try out our new Cocoapod strategy.
  - By not commiting `Pods`-folder into git.
  - Next meeting we'll discuss how this is working out.

- Clean up project structure in FinniversKit.
  - Move all the demo- and helper-classes out of the `Source` folder.
  - Move all the assets to `Source/Resources` etc.
  - Remove ignores from the `podspec` file.
    - As a result of assets and demoViews being moved.

# Merry Christmas to you all! ðŸŽ…ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ‰

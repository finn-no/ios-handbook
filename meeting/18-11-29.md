### Long Term goal:
- Remove Carthage as dependency manager.

### Short Term goal:
- Cocoapods support in `FINNClient`. This is also a pilot project.
- Remove `FINNClient` from FINN.no a Carthage dependency.
- Add line break rules to Swiftlint.

### Release agreements:
- Create initial beta from `master`-branch.
- Use `git cherry-pick` only for hot-fixes or important changes.
  - `cherry-pick` should be done on the release-branch.

### Code style:
- Use "common sense" for placing newlines between parameters within long method signatures.
  - Method signatures should be, at max, ~120 characters.

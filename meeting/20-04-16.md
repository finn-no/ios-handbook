# iOS meeting 16.04.20
## Top crashes
We have some crashes related to the bottomsheet that we do not quite understand. Everyone is encouraged to have a look and see if they figure something out. 

It is not so many crashes that it is a major problem, but they have been there for many versions now.

## Catalina
Nothing new with upgrade status.

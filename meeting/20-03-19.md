# iOS meeting 19.03.20
## Firebase
Next release will be using Firebase for crash reporting. Hopefully there should be no issues.

### "Soft errors"
You can start adding soft error reporting now, it will show up in Firebase. But think about what to report since it could have some performance impacts, donâ€™t report errors inside a loop. Received data not being parsed properly is a good example of something that should be reported as a soft error.

## Testing
We might have some troubles testing on old iOS versions and on a variety of devices since we do not have quick access to the test ab anymore.

## ObservePoint
We can start testing ObservePoint service, it could be useful to help make sure important tracking is not lost. Since it actually runs the app it will at same time be doing some UI testing for us. Not sure how performant it is as of yet.

## Meetups once a week
The iOS dev meetup will be held Thursdays at 12 every week while we are working from home.

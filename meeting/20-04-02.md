# iOS meeting 02.04.20
## Eastern release
Will be done on schedule.

## Xcode 11.4
We can't move fully to Catalina yet, so we are still in a mixed Xcode 11.4 and 11.3 mode.

There are a couple of issues so far:
- Running FinniversKit snapshot tests on 11.4 gives a few errors, there seem to be some slight pixel diffs. To get all the snapshots green you need to run Xcode 11.3.
- There is a potential issue building release with 11.4, giving sgmentation faults. It is unsure if it will affect the main app or if it is something related to SwiftUI. If there is an issue we might need to build releases with Xcode 11.3 as well.

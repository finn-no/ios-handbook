## Reduce storyboards

## QA testing, time to refactor

We need someone with the responsability to test. We've seeing a few issues lately that feel quite random. 

Off-topic but relevant: Not enough time for refactoring.

## Design

How is going in your areas? Shortcomings status?

- Ad In: Approval of proposed designs, not enough people
- Ad Out: Hard to know who's working on what some nice initiatives
- Platform: Nice ideas, when it comes to integrations can be challenging since designers don't have full control, when it comes to Finnivers it works great

New Design Director coming, recruiting will resume, we'll aim for influencing to get more app designers

## View Navigator Coordinator

Suggestion on architecture for the iOS app: https://github.com/finn-no/CaptainNavigator

## Network Client

We're improving security in the network calls and also have some shortcomings partly because it relays on AFNetworking, the idea is to refactor it and discuss how.

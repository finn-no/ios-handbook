# iOS meeting 02.05.19
## Started with quick round of "what's up"
Probably something we will want to do every time and not noted in meeting notes. Mainly an opportunity to tell new/fun/FYI things to spread information across domains. No need to mention everything you work on.

## Swift 5
We will try to get updating all our repos to Swift 5 prioritized and done soon. Was no issues updating Charcoal.

## Versioning FinniversKit
Same versioning model as Charcoal. We can use same script as Charcoal, but best practise would also be to create a Release in Github.

## Easter eggs
Need to get a better overview of what to do with existing ones. Ideally separate them more and have all of them in a single repo.

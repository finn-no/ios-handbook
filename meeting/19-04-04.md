## Versioning our repos
We have decided to use tags for lightweight versioning of our own repos. At the moment we point our Podfile to master branch, which makes the only noticeable change after an update that the commit hash has changed. If there is a conflict that forces us to manually lookup the commit hash to see which is newer. If we point to specific tags in the repo (with logical naming) it should be much easier to see which tag is newer when diffing the conflicted file(s).

We should make scripts to make creating a tag easy and naming them automatic.
